This repository contains the DMRG code and data for arXiv:2509.02757

The numerical code calculates the ground state of triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model with pi/2 flux per triangle plaquette, see F. Chen, W. O. Huang, J. X. Zhang, L. Balents,  D. N. Sheng, arXiv e-prints, arXiv:2509.02757 for details.

The lattice size Num_site=Nx*Ny, and lengths parameters (Nx, Ny) can be found in common.f90. The lattice geometry can be determined as square=1, or triangle=1. For different system sizes, one needs to change Nx, Ny accordingly. Notice that Ny=6 (6-leg) can be down in 1-2 weeks if keeps 3000-6000 states. Ny=8 usually takes much longer time.

The code main.f90 has more parameters you can adjust:

From line 23, kept_min, and kept_max are the range of bond dimensions. Set kept_max as initial disired bond dimensions. kept_maxf as final bond dimension. Sweep_num usually needs to be around 6-10+ (more sweeps give better convergence). For example, one can set:

kept_min=1600 kept_max=2000 Kept_maxf=4000 sweep_num=8 you job will be done with bond dimension 4000, after eight complete sweeps.

The "hubbard" parameter in quantum.f90 sets up the value of U in the model, and theta sets up the flux per triangle. The energy unit is t=1.


To start the job, you do make which generates the compiled program tjsq.out The intel new compiler ifort version 2021.5.0 is used. For other version, one needs to do adjustment for the makefile.

For initial job, you need to edit restart.dat to be in the form 0 0 0

common.f90 have commonly used parameters and data structures

main.f90 have parameters for the job and perform simulations for ground state and measurements.

dmrg_sub.f90 have subroutines for setting up the dmrg, set up neighboring coupings. It also contains the dmrg codes for doping infinite process (warm_up), left_to_right and right_to_left sweepings.

den_mat find the eigenstates of reduced density matrix.

eigen.f90 perform the lanczos calculations for ground state.

get_sys update the dmrg blocks (including operators), perform truncations and also operator*vectors for lanczos.

measure.f90 perform the measurements

The DMRG method follows Steve White's original algorithm with including SU2 spin rotational symmetry. The code was built based on original U1 code of Hong Chen Jiang (2008) and detailed note of Shoushu Gong (2020) for SU2 implimentation. Many thanks to Hong Chen and Shoushu!
